# Weekly Notes
### Date: 27 June 2019 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped Kyle, another REU intern on some R coding questions. I talked with Miguel and Lindsay about requirements for the Tukey HSD test, and we all figured out together some R coding details for that (must be set as factors). Outside of research, I helped Ellen and Margaret clean up from the BBQ.  

#### Who helped you this week?

Andrew and Lindsay helped me get back some missing plots 20 minutes before my meeting with Kathy. Turns out it was some mislabeling in code. Lindsay also helped me with a line of code "mutate" in order to determine decadal changes in zooplankton. Miguel helped me understand the statiscal differences between ANOVA and TUKEY HSD. Sam's R training course for all REU interns was extremely helpful! 

#### What did you achieve?

* Made time series line plots for yearly average anamolies, and all quarters 
* Learned how to do basic statistical analysis in R and applied it to my zooplankton    anamoly data to see if there is differences between decades 
* Finally figured out some details wit github, got set up on freedcamp and mendeley
* Entirely read through the lab's page on github 
* Gained a better understanding of decadal changes on callanus 
* Posted my first question on stack overflow 
* Completely finished the R training program that Sam provided 
* Attended my first lab meeting and first tidyverse thursday session 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I tried (too long) to make my line plots cleaner by adding a dashed line in between   misssing values. I posted on stack overflow to get some help and got some code that     worked, but I need to figure out a way to map it to each graph that I have 
* Trying to get the TUKEY HSD stats analysis to comply with my data, but we eventually   figured it out 
* Learning curve in figuring out how to successfully clone the github repository        branch

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Look into physical data 
* Determine correlations between stratification index and temperature, and strat index and salinity 
* Determine if I have to create a loop code (with help from Sam) to determine a stratification index, or if I can just use the code that Matt provided to me the beginning of last week 


#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* I want to make sure that I'm on the right track with my processing of both the biologial and the physical data. At this point I've spent more time on the biological data than I've allotted for myself, so I just want to make sure it's okay that I keep analyzing this instead of moving onto the physical data 

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* I may need help in making sure that I've cloned and pulled correctly from the tidyverse github repository 

#### Any other topics

* This lab seems extremely organized from what I can tell after reading the lab welcome sheet in github, and I'm grateful to have been placed in this lab out of all available at GMRI. I believe this is the best spot I could have been placed for my own advancement in R and statistical analysis

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* I will need help from Miguel on the TUKEY code. 

#### Any other topics

* This REU went by too quickly. I don't want to leave yet!

# Weekly Notes
### Date: 8 July 2019 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped Keith and Zach with some seining field work. 

#### Who helped you this week?

Lindsay helped me with R coding questions, Sam helped me with placing a fitted line on my plots, Andy helped me determine which depths and plots to analyze and how to do so. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Presented my chosen reading at journal club  
* Presented my progress report and asked for feedback 
* Created time series plots for all my data available
* Placed into powerpoint (Andy's suggestion) to look over and analyze 
* Understood how to read and manipulate the buoy data to do so 


#### What did you struggle with?

* I did not have a lot of time last week to work on my own research. Seining field work took all day with journal club afterward, then the fourth of July everyone was unavailable or away. I did not have a lot of time in the lab to focus or to be with other colleagues to ask questions. I'm using this week to catch up. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* This week I'm going to finish analyzing the buoy data by faceting the plots avaiable, and looking over anything that visually jumps out at me. After that, I'm going to conduct any statistical analysis necessary and then try to move into the correllation aspect of my work. I'm on track as of right now. 


#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* I will need some help on how to conduct the correllation analysis in R 
* After peeking at all produced plots tonight, I want to discuss further steps 

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* Nothing as of right now 

#### Any other topics

* Had a great 4th weekend!
