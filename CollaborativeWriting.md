# Collaborative Writing
>"While [the writer] works [they are] alone. If the work is difficult . . .[they] feel alone, and sometimes even abandoned. But the real question is: how much loneliness can you know? But the word itself isn't especially accurate, in any case: that which is named loneliness is probably more nearly ineffectiveness, a form of failure, a form of fear. ...
When the going is good a writer knows very little, if any loneliness. When it is bad [they] believe [they] know nothing else. The flaw is the same in either event: when the writer thought the going was good and therefore felt no loneliness, the writing was not necessarily good, and when [they] believed the going was bad and therefore felt ineffective, the writing may actually have been good. [They] just happened to feel loneliness at the time. If it wasn'tsomething [they] ate, it was surely something that was eating [them]." - "Why Does a Writer Write? *In* Writer to Writer, ed. Floyd Watkins and KarlKnight(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1966), p. 30.</>

## Overview
Although the lab has made great strides towards implementing collaborative and supportive data analysis workflows and practices, the writing process is still largely carried out in solitude. Potentially even more problematic, many of us do not spend time regulalry reading or writing. We spend a whole lot of time on the data analysis side, working together with confidence, and then isolate ourselves, put in our headphones, open up a blank word document and attempt to write a manuscript for publication in a high-level peer reviewed journal. It's no wonder then that the writing process is such an incredible bottleneck as we struggle to put words to paper. 

To break through this bottleneck and produce higher quality papers more efficiently, we need to change how we work. That's where the idea of collaborative writing comes in. Since we haven't done this before, this is definitely a work in progress. 

## Guiding Principles
Writing is incredibly personal. To make sure that everyone feels safe and supported in sharing their writing, we have developed the following guiding principles:

### As a reviewer...
- Respect the effort that has gone into producing the work you are reading: writing isn't easy!

- Be constructive, avoid value laden statements, and remember that just because something doesn't make sense to you, or doesn't sound right to you, doesn't mean that's the case for the author or other readers.
  * For example, instead of "This paragraph doesn't make any sense" try "I had trouble understanding this paragraph because I couldnâ€™t see how it tied back to our main argument."
  
- Make sure to look for strengths of the paper and mention those along with any constructive comments.

- Provide both technical and emotional support throughout the entire writing process, not just the end.

- Be an empathetic reviewer, placing yourself in the author's shoes and think about your own experience struggling to write that introduction or final paragraph of your discussion. 

### As an author...
- Check your ego at the door. We can all improve our writing.

- Don't just focus on the weaknesses or the suggested edits, make sure to remind yourself about the strengths of your paper, too.

- Celebrate the little victories. Writing is difficult and if you wait until you hit the submit button on your manuscript to celebrate your accomplishments, you're likely going to be disappointed. By that time in the process, many of us are are sick of our paper and we hit the submission button with a "get this out of my face" frustration. Of course this collaborative approach hopes to combat that by increasing our efficiency, but we can also make sure to celebrate each of the steps along the process to hopefully make the submission a celebration.

## Reviewing Guidelines
Along with the guiding principles, another key component of an effective colloaborative writing or peer-review process is ensuring that the reviewers have clear guidelines. To facilitate that, each reviewer should complete their review and address the following questions. Thanks to [Aly McKnight](https://www.unity.edu/employee/alyson-mcknight/) for a lot of these!

### General questions
- What is the underlying question that the research addresses?

- What are the goals and objectives of the work that will support answering the research question?

- What story does the paper tell? Think about the key parts to any story.

- What are the takeaway messages of the paper?

- Is the structure of the paper clear and easy to follow?

### Specific components
- Introduction: Does the introduction captivate the reader and set the stage for the analysis?

- Methods: Are the methods clear? Could you repeat this analysis if you had the data? How about the data and the code?

- Results: Do the results answer the questions of the paper? 

- Discussion/Conclusion: Does the discussion put the results in a broader context? Are the discussion topics related to the ones presented in the introduction?
