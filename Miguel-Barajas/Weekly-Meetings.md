# Weekly Notes
### Date: 28 June 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* This week I helped Mike with his presentation by sending him some data summary slides for the Penobscot River Atlantic salmon growth data. I helped Lindsay with plotting salmon migration area shapefiles. I also helped Ally with plotting results from Tukey tests.

#### Who helped you this week?

* Lindsay helped me by discussing how we should work together to bring in SST data into our salmon scales growth marker analyses. Andrew helped me with some code for correlating SST rasters with salmon scale data. Kathy helped me by sending some tutorials on GAMs.

#### What did you achieve?

* This week I ran stat summaries for the salmon return time phenology data filtered by sea-age, put together sample size data tables for the growth data to make sure sampling distributions were good, starting looking into building GAMs for summer/winter metrics, and starting working on spatial correlations between SST and salmon scale growth marker data.

#### What did you struggle with?

* This week I struggled with reading up more on GAMs and trying to get an understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes in order to build modles that are appropriate.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week I would like to continue working on the SST spatial correlations with the salmon scale growth marker data.

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week I'll be heading to Orono to get more scale samples so I need Kathy to put together the list of scales that I'll collect
